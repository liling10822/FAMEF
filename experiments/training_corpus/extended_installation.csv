215,https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,Installing Python
216,https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,"If you are using Windows, we recommend installing the Anaconda distribution of Python 3. This distribution has the majority of dependencies that HyVR requires."
217,https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,It is also a good idea to install the HyVR package into a virtual environment. Do this by opening a command prompt window and typing the following:
218,https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,conda create --name hyvr_env
219,https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,You need to then activate this environment:
220,https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,conda activate hyvr_env
221,https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,Linux
222,https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,"Depending on your preferences you can either use the Anaconda/Miniconda distribution of python, or the version of your package manager. If you choose the former, follow the same steps as for Windows."
223,https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,"If you choose the latter, you probably already have Python 3 installed. If not, you can install it using your package manager (e.g. apt on Ubuntu/Debian)."
224,https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,In any way we recommend using a virtual environment. Non-conda users can use virtualenvwrapper or pipenv.

490,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Rasterio has a C library dependency: GDAL >=1.11. GDAL itself depends on some other libraries provided by most major operating systems and also depends on the non standard GEOS and PROJ4 libraries. How to meet these requirement will be explained below.
491,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Rasterio's Python dependencies are listed in its requirements.txt file.
492,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Development also requires (see requirements-dev.txt) Cython and other packages.
493,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Binary Distributions
494,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Use a binary distributions that directly or indirectly provide GDAL if possible.
495,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Rasterio distributions are available from UbuntuGIS and Anaconda's conda-forge channel.
496,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Manylinux1 wheels are available on PyPI.
497,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,OS X
498,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"Binary distributions with GDAL, GEOS, and PROJ4 libraries included are available for OS X versions 10.7+ starting with Rasterio version 0.17. To install, run pip install rasterio. These binary wheels are preferred by newer versions of pip."
499,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"If you don't want these wheels and want to install from a source distribution, run pip install rasterio --no-binary rasterio instead."
500,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"The included GDAL library is fairly minimal, providing only the format drivers that ship with GDAL and are enabled by default. To get access to more formats, you must build from a source distribution (see below)."
501,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Binary wheels for rasterio and GDAL are created by Christoph Gohlke and are available from his website.
502,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"To install rasterio, simply download both binaries for your system (rasterio and GDAL) and run something like this from the downloads folder:"
503,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ pip install -U pip
504,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ pip install GDAL-2.0.2-cp27-none-win32.whl

507,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ conda install -c conda-forge rasterio
508,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Source Distributions
509,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Rasterio is a Python C extension and to build you'll need a working compiler (XCode on OS X etc). You'll also need Numpy preinstalled; the Numpy headers are required to run the rasterio setup script. Numpy has to be installed (via the indicated requirements file) before rasterio can be installed. See rasterio's Travis configuration for more guidance.
510,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,The following commands are adapted from Rasterio's Travis-CI configuration.
511,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
512,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ sudo apt-get update

518,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ brew install gdal
519,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ pip install --no-use-wheel rasterio
520,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"Alternatively, you can install GDAL binaries from kyngchaos. You will then need to add the installed location /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs to your system path."
521,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"When building from source on Windows, it is important to know that setup.py cannot rely on gdal-config, which is only present on UNIX systems, to discover the locations of header files and libraries that rasterio needs to compile its C extensions. On Windows, these paths need to be provided by the user. You will need to find the include files and the library files for gdal and use setup.py as follows."
522,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ python setup.py build_ext -I<path to gdal include files> -lgdal_i -L<path to gdal library>
523,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ python setup.py install
524,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,We have had success compiling code using the same version of Microsoft's Visual Studio used to compile the targeted version of Python (more info on versions used here.).
525,https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Note: The GDAL dll (gdal111.dll) and gdal-data directory need to be in your Windows PATH otherwise rasterio will fail to work.
