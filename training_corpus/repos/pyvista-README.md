PyVista is a helper module for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) that takes a
different approach on interfacing with VTK through NumPy and direct array
access. This package provides a Pythonic, well-documented interface exposing
VTK's powerful visualization backend to facilitate rapid prototyping, analysis,
and visual integration of spatially referenced datasets.

This module can be used for scientific plotting for presentations and research
papers as well as a supporting module for other mesh 3D rendering dependent
Python modules; see Connections for a list of projects that leverage
PyVista.

Overview of Features
--------------------

* Embeddable rendering in Jupyter Notebooks
* Filtering/plotting tools built for interactivity in Jupyter notebooks (see `IPython Tools`_)
* Direct access to mesh analysis and transformation routines (see Filters_)
* Intuitive plotting routines with ``matplotlib`` similar syntax (see Plotting_)
* Import meshes from many common formats (use ``pyvista.read()``)
* Export meshes as VTK, STL, OBJ, or PLY file types

Installation
============

PyVista can be installed from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvista>`_
using ``pip`` on Python >= 3.5::

    pip install pyvista

You can also visit `PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvista>`_,
`Anaconda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyvista>`_, or
`GitHub <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista>`_ to download the source.

See the `Installation <http://docs.pyvista.org/getting-started/installation.html#install-ref.>`_
for more details if the installation through pip doesn't work out.

Connections
===========

PyVista is a powerful tool that researchers can harness to create compelling,
integrated visualizations of large datasets in an intuitive, Pythonic manner.
Here are a few open-source projects that leverage PyVista:

* pyansys_: Pythonic interface to ANSYS result, full, and archive files
* PVGeo_: Python package of VTK-based algorithms to analyze geoscientific data and models. PyVista is used to make the inputs and outputs of PVGeo's algorithms more accessible.
* omfvista_: 3D visualization for the Open Mining Format (omf). PyVista provides the foundation for this library's visualization.
* discretize_: Discretization tools for finite volume and inverse problems. ``discretize`` provides ``toVTK`` methods that return PyVista versions of their data types for `creating compelling visualizations`_.
* pymeshfix_: Python/Cython wrapper of Marco Attene's wonderful, award-winning MeshFix software.
* tetgen_: Python Interface to Hang Si's C++ TetGen Library
