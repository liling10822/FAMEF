`readgssi` is a tool intended for use as an open-source reader and preprocessing module for subsurface data collected with Geophysical Survey Systems Incorporated (GSSI) ground-penetrating georadar (GPR) devices. It has the capability to read DZT and DZG files with the same pre-extension name and plot the data contained in those files. `readgssi` is also currently able to translate most DZT files to CSV and will be able to translate to other output formats including HDF5  (see [future](#future)). Matlab code donated by [Gabe Lewis](https://earthsciences.dartmouth.edu/people/gabriel-lewis), Dartmouth College Department of Earth Sciences. Python adaptation written with permission by Ian Nesbitt, University of Maine School of Earth and Climate Sciences.

The file read parameters are based on GSSI's DZT file description, similar to the ones available on pages 55-57 of the [SIR-3000 manual](https://support.geophysical.com/gssiSupport/Products/Documents/Control%20Unit%20Manuals/GSSI%20-%20SIR-3000%20Operation%20Manual.pdf). File structure is, unfortunately, prone to change at any time, and although I've been able to test with files from several systems, I have not encountered every iteration of file header yet. If you run into trouble, please [create a github issue](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/issues).

Questions, feature requests, and bugs: please [open a github issue](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/issues). Kindly provide the error output, describe what you are attempting to do, and attach the DZT/DZG file(s) causing you trouble.

```

From a unix command line:
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT
```
Simply specifying an input DZT file like in the above command (`-i file`) will display a host of data about the file including:
- name of GSSI control unit
- antenna model
- antenna frequency
- samples per trace
- bits per sample
- traces per second
- L1 dielectric as entered during survey
- sampling depth
- speed of light at given dielectric
- number of traces
- number of seconds

## basic functionality
### CSV output
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o test.csv -f CSV
```
Translates radar data array to CSV format, if that's your cup of tea. One might use this to export to Matlab. One CSV will be written per channel. The script will rename the output to 'test_100MHz.csv' automatically. No header information is included in the CSV.

```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -s 8 -w -r -o test.csv -f CSV
```
Applies 8x stacking, dewow, and background removal filters before exporting to CSV.

### plotting
#### example 1A
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -p 5 -s auto -c viridis -m
```
The above command will cause `readgssi` to save and show a plot named "DZT__001_100MHz.png" with a y-size of 6 inches at 150 dpi (`-p 6`) and the autostacking algorithm will stack the x-axis to some multiple of times shorter than the original data array for optimal viewing on a monitor, approximately 2.5\*y (`-s auto`). The plot will be rendered in the viridis color scheme, which is the default for matplotlib. The `-m` flag will draw a histogram for each data channel.
![Example 1a](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/1a.png)
![Example 1a histogram](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/1a-h.png)

#### example 1B
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1b.png -p 5 -s auto -c viridis -g 50 -m -r -w
```
This will cause `readgssi` to create a plot from the same file, but matplotlib will save the plot as "1b.png" (`-o 1b.png`). The script will plot the y-axis size (`-p 5`) and automatically stack the x-axis to (`-s auto`). The script will plot the data with a gain value of 50 (`-g 50`), which will increase the plot contrast by a factor of 50. Next `readgssi` will run the background removal (`-r`) and dewow (`-w`) filters. Finally, the `-m` flag will draw a histogram for each data channel. Note how the histogram changes when filters are applied.

#### example 1C: gain can be tricky depending on your colormap
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1c.png -p 5 -s auto -r -w -c seismic
```
Here, background removal and dewow filters are applied, but no gain adjustments are made (equivalent to `-g 1`). The script uses matplotlib's "seismic" colormap (`-c seismic`) which is specifically designed for this type of waterfall array plotting. Even without gain, you will often be able to easily see very slight signal perturbations. It is not colorblind-friendly for either of the two most common types of human colorblindness, however, which is why it is not the default colormap.
![Example 1c](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/1c.png)

#### example 2A: no background removal
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2a.png -p 10 -s 3 -n
```
Here `readgssi` will create a plot of size 10 and stack 3x (`-p 10 -s 3`). Matplotlib will use the default "Greys" colormap and save a PNG of the figure, but the script will suppress the matplotlib window (`-n`, useful for processing an entire directory full of DZTs at once).
![Example 2a](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/raw/master/examples/2a.png)

#### example 2B: horizontal mean BGR algorithm applied
```bash
readgssi -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2b.png -p 10 -s 3 -n -r
```
The script does the same thing, except it applies horizontal mean background removal `-r`. Note the difference in ringing artifacts between examples 2a and 2b.

  - velocity-based depth adjustments
  - ability to incorporate ground truth measurements
- velocity gradient/angle of incidence-based array migration
